          Our mission is to provide a trusted and experienced online resource
          for the retail community. We are committed to providing our members
          with a wide range of products and services. This allows you to shop
          with confidence knowing you are shopping with a trusted brand that
          knows and understands the marketplace. We do this by delivering a wide
          selection of products and services that are tailored to fit your
          lifestyle. The company is founded by Anna and Michael Hofer, who have
          a keen interest in children’s fashion. Their aim is to provide the
          best possible shopping experience for children and their parents and
          to support the companies that do. Anna and Michael are passionate
          about children’s fashion and the role it plays in the lives of
          children. They believe that children can never grow up without
          fashion, and that fashion should always be available for them. 'We
          love children’s clothing. We believe that every child should have a
          wonderful wardrobe filled with clothes that will make them feel good.
          We love that children love clothes, that they want to look good and
          that they want to be in good clothes. We have created a fashion
          website where parents can find their children’s clothing, so they can
          take care of their children’s clothing and enjoy the good times.'
